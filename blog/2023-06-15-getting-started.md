# Getting Started with Web Development in 2023

Web development continues to evolve at a rapid pace. If you're just starting your journey or looking to update your skills, here's a guide to the essential technologies and practices in 2023.

## Frontend Essentials

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The core trio of web development remains essential:

- **HTML5**: Semantic elements, accessibility, and structure
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Modern ES6+ syntax, async/await, and DOM manipulation

### Frontend Frameworks

React continues to dominate the landscape, but other frameworks offer compelling alternatives:

- **React**: Component-based development with hooks and context
- **Vue.js**: Progressive framework with excellent documentation
- **Svelte**: Compile-time framework with less boilerplate
- **Angular**: Complete solution for enterprise applications

## Backend Development

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express**: Minimal web framework for Node.js
- **Deno**: Secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript

## Next Steps

In future posts, we'll dive deeper into each of these technologies with practical examples and tutorials.
